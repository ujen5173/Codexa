# Codexa

Codexa is a web-based platform for technical writers to write, publish, and manage technical articles. The system is designed with a clear separation of concerns, predictable logic, and a scalable structure suitable for real-world content platforms.

This project was developed as a 6th Semester College Project.

## Overview

Codexa focuses on the core problems of technical content platforms: structured writing, controlled publishing, and efficient content discovery. The application supports article lifecycle management, user authentication, content organization through tags, and logic-driven ranking and search. The architecture prioritizes maintainability, performance, and clarity over unnecessary complexity.
